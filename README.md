# fintrust-AI-Repo
this repository is basically build on the basis of the problme statement given to us where we going to build ai powered fintech and intelligent finance using frontend..


PROBLEM STATEMENT:- AI FINTECH AND INTELLIGENCE FINANCE
Traditional scoring systems:
~ depends on recent credit history.
~ excludes traditonal credit scoring excludes indiviuals without credit history and lacks trasparency.

SOLUTION:
[we have made "CREDWISE" for the solution as credwise is an AI-powered platform we build ] 
it uses financial indicators like income expenses, loan account, and calculating risk and storing credit score.
we have used in our project "frontend(css/html/javascript)","backend(python flask, numpy, json, node.js)"

scoring logic is been calculated on the basis of monthy income, monthly expenses and amount of loan and years to pay.
~debt to income ratio
~risk logic algorithm
~explainable output system

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE-->
USER--> FRONTEND--> SCORING ENGINE--> JSON response--> Dashboard(inteface/UI)

IN FRONTEND: 
(We used html/css and javascript to make an user interface for our project)

INNOVATION:-
~ Uses alternative finance indicators
~ Transparent explainable scoring
~ scalable API based architecture

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:-
-> banking api integration
--> Credit bureau data integration
--> additionally, in future we can connect backend to provide block chained based financial verification via machine learning integration.
